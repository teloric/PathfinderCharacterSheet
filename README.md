# PathfinderCharacterSheet
This is an open source libreoffice based character sheet for the Pathfinder roleplaying game.
<div>

## Welcome to the new Pathfinder Character Sheet

# Important things to know.

<span style="background-color:#baffd9">Cells in this color</span> are data entry points for formulas and need to be filled in by the user for the formulas to work.  
<span style="background-color:#ccccff">Cells in this color</span> are the results of formulas and should not be changed unless you wish to change the formula

This sheet was writting in [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and that is the only supported format. It will work with degraded features in openoffice and excel.

When you get the this file most of the extra class sheets will be hidden.

To unhide the sheets you want go to formatsheetshow and select the sheet you wish to have visible.

on spell ranges and durations find the range or duration which matches what you are looking for then go to the cell and enter the = sign then the cell reference that range or duration for example =AY4

some cells have comments to help explain their use, keep an eye out for them

I have locked most the sheets against changing anything other then data entry points. If you wish to change the formatting just unlock the sheet, they are locked but have no password. I would recommend relocking the sheets afterward. ToolsProtect DocumentSheet (then just ok with no password)

To unprotect a cell so you can type in it after relocking a sheet right click the cell(s) and Format CellsProtected Cells(this is a tab) uncheck the protected checkbox

Adjust the Viewzoom to your prefernce. Remember with the right zoom you can have 2 sheets side by side.

Once you are familiar with the contents of the welcome sheet, just hide it by formatsheethide

If any issues are found please report them at [https://github.com/teloric/PathfinderCharacterSheet/issues/](https://github.com/teloric/PathfinderCharacterSheet/issues/) and I will do my best to fix it in the next release.
